# Address-Book-Lookup

This program is designed to allow a user to search a dictionary pre-loaded with keys and values from each line within the "address.txt" file for either the phone number or an address associated with it.  The user is initially prompted for their choice between an address or a phone number and then prompted to submit the FIRST and LAST name of the person who's information is being requested. If the name entered is in the required format and validated, it's then taken and compared to the keys within the dictionary "data". Upon finding a matching key, the specified output is formatted and printed to the screen before prompting the user for another name to search. The program will continue to loop until the user submits a blank line, once submitted the program will close.

Input: Choice between output types (1)Address or (2)Phone Numbers. User inputs data from the keyboard for the First and Last name in that specific order, in order to be searched within the database read from the "address.txt" file.

Output: Prints a formatted output of either the address or phone number of the search results specified by the user and found within the dictionary.
